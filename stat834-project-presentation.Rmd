- Different statistical tests


## Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF)

- A kind of optical fiber that uses photonic crystals to form the cladding around the core of the cable.


- A low-loss periodic dielectric medium constructed using a periodic array of microscopic air holes that run along the entire fiber length. 

- Light travels through the core using the refraction property of light, which occurs because of the difference between the refractive indices of the core and cladding.

- Use total internal reflection or light confinement in hollow core methods to propagate light
